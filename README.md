# Pokemon-Reborn-Fishing
Hello, if anyone is reading this, welcome, I suppose.

This is a manual for obtaining the ultimate fish in pokemon Reborn; the Magikarp.
To do so, one MUST do several things; 
at the start of the game, buy the Magikarp in the Grand Hall,
then, defeat the two con artists at the top of Peridot ward,
After the first gym, defeat the kid in the slums who stole it from them,
after Corey, beat the grunt who stole it from the kid in Upper Obsidia Ward,
find your fellow gang member who stole it in Lapis Ward,
Buy the magikarp again in 7th Street,
After Ciel, Talk to the police chief,
Find the Three Corin Rouges,
then, defeat Adrianne, and talk to the hidden Corin Rouge in xer gym,
chase the imposter to the north of Peridot Ward, 
talk to the police chief once again,
and finally, defeat the true and final Corin Rouge, and take your victory from his
cold, damp hands.

You must start with the passwords Weathermod Watermono active, so that you can get all the checks. You can only
use pokemon you click as checks, and you must activate Debug Mode. There are items called "Cheats" that
allow you to change things in the debug menu about your pokemon, to remove grinding and make the game faster.

Some checks might become unavailable due to the update to reborn city halfway through the game;
Just send them if you have progressed past the point where they would be required. I could logically require
the things that would let you get all the checks that you missed, but that would be self-enforced and feel 
kind of arbitrary.

I'm planning on someday making a full-blown reborn manual for the entire game, although I would like to figure
out if there's a way to access the early game locations again throuh debug mode before I do that.
